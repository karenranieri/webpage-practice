                    <p> The winter of 2017 I went on a crazy adventure known as Skibattical. I walked away from my career in order to try and restore balance to my universe. The stories told here are a depiction of that adventure. 6 months of skiing, travelling, and meeting new people resulted in a better understanding of who I am, how to live in the now, and what I want for my future.</p>

                <p> I am an ambassador for the first and only women's run ski company. They make skis and snowboards that don't suck! Putting an end to the shrink it and pink it movement that has dominated women's skis for decades. We are dedicated to growing our sisterhood of shred that creates an inspirational environment for females to connect and help build the community of lady shredders!</p>
